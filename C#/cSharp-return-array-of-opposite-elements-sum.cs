// You are given an array of n integers, where n ranges from 2 to 200, inclusive. The elements in the array range from -200 to 200, inclusive. 
// Your task is to return an array in which each element is the sum of a pair composed of an element and its 'opposite' element.
// By 'opposite', we mean that in an array of n elements, the first and last elements are paired, the second and second-to-last elements are paired, and so on.
// If the array is of odd length, the middle element pairs with itself.
// The function should handle both positive and negative integers and be capable of dealing with an odd number of elements in the list.

// For example, given an input array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], your function should return [6, 6, 6].
// This is because the first element 1 plus the last element 5 equals 6, the second element 2 plus the second-to-last element 4 equals 6, and the middle element 3 plus itself equals 6.
